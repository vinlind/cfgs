# CS2
launch options: `+fps_max 0 -novid -high -allow_third_party_software -fullscreen -w 1280 -h 960 -language vinlind -exec autoexec`

this autoexec is modualr, meaning each individual .cfg from `autoexec_modues` gets executed when autoexec.cfg is run

my OLD csgo settings can be viewed in detail at https://settings.gg/vinlind
