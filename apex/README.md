# Apex Legends
launch options:`-dev -console -high +exec autoexec.cfg`

**autoexec.cfg** goes in the /cfg/ folder where Apex is installed. for me thats "D:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Apex Legends/cfg

**videoconfig.txt** and **settings.cfg** go in "C:/Users/<username>/Saved Games/Respawn/Apex/local"
