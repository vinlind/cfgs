# Apex Legends
launch options: `-dev -console -high +exec autoexec.cfg`

_**autoexec.cfg**_ goes in the **cfg/** folder where Apex is installed. for me thats **"D:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Apex Legends/cfg**

_**videoconfig.txt**_ and _**settings.cfg**_ go in **"C:/Users/\<username\>/Saved Games/Respawn/Apex/local"**
