# Apex Legends
launch options: `+exec autoexec +fps_max 200 -dev -novid`

_**autoexec.cfg**_ goes in the `cfg/` folder where Apex is installed. for me thats **"D:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Apex Legends/cfg/"**

_**videoconfig.txt**_ and _**settings.cfg**_ go in `C:/Users/<username>/Saved Games/Respawn/Apex/local/`
