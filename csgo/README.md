# CS:GO
launch options: `+exec autoexec.cfg -tickrate 128 +fps_max 0 -novid -language vcustom -fullscreen -allow_third_party_software`

files starting with a bang are scripts that i execute manually to change things like my viewmodel and crosshair while in-game

_**csgo_vcustom.txt**_ is my custom language file, its really just [BananaGaming's Text Color Mod](https://maximhere.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Text_Color_Mod_4.2b_by_BananaGaming.zip)  with very minor tweaks. it goes in `csgo/resource/`

my csgo settings can be viewed in detail at https://settings.gg/vinlind
