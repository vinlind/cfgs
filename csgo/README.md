# CS:GO
launch options: `+exec autoexec.cfg -tickrate 64 +fps_max 0 -novid -language epiccolor`

files starting with a bang are scripts that i execute manually to change things like my viewmodel and crosshair while in-game

_**csgo_epiccolor.txt**_ is my custom language file, based heavily on [BananaGaming's Text Color Mod](https://maximhere.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Text_Color_Mod_4.2b_by_BananaGaming.zip)  with very minor tweaks. it goes in "csgo/resource/"
