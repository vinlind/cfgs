# cfgs
my configs, scripts and autoexec files for source games

my csgo settings can be viewed in detail at https://settings.gg/vinlind

while i do provide comments on some parts these files, they are mainly made for myself. many many cvars are not explained adequately or at all.

feel free to use and edit these as much as you'd like i really dont give a shit if you steal them
