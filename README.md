# cfgs
my configs, scripts and autoexec files for source games

my csgo settings can be viewed in detail at https://settings.gg/vinlind

i use [RawAccel](https://github.com/a1xd/rawaccel) for mouse acceleration, my current settings for version 1.6.0 can be found in this directory

***while i do provide comments on some parts these files, they are mainly made for myself. most cvars are not explained adequately or at all.

feel free to use and edit these as much as you'd like i really dont give a shit if you steal them
